# eyecare-daemon
A small python script that will send a notification to you every 20 minutes, asking you to look away for 20 seconds.

For the system notification, it uses the linux `notify-send` command, and should work with any distro (tested on Arch using Dunst for notifications).

I plan to add support for sleep mode, depending on how the testing goes.
